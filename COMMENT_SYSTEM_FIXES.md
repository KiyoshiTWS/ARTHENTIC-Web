# Comment System Enhancements - Complete Fix

## Issues Resolved ‚úÖ

### 1. Profile Picture Placeholders in Comments
**Problem**: Hardcoded placeholder images (`https://placehold.co/28x28`) appeared instead of user profile pictures in quick comment inputs.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced hardcoded placeholder with dynamic user avatar: `${(window.auth && window.auth.user && window.auth.user.profile_picture) ? window.auth.user.profile_picture : getDefaultAvatar()}`
- Added proper authentication checks and fallback to `getDefaultAvatar()`
- Disabled input and showed appropriate placeholder text when not logged in

### 2. Unresponsive Comment Like Buttons
**Problem**: Comment like buttons lacked visual feedback and proper error handling.

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: 
  - Added scale animations (scale 1.1 on click, scale 0.95 for rapid clicks)
  - Implemented heart pulse animation for likes: `@keyframes heartPulse`
  - Added proper color states (red for liked, gray for unliked)
  - Smooth transitions with `transition: all 0.2s ease`

- **Improved Responsiveness**:
  - Optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
  - Proper error handling with revert functionality
  - Prevention of multiple rapid clicks with processing state
  - Better hover effects with background color changes

- **Better Error Recovery**:
  - Server response validation and UI sync
  - Graceful fallback on network errors
  - Toast notifications for failed operations

### 3. Plus Button Functionality Issues
**Problem**: Basic plus button with limited functionality and poor user experience.

**Enhanced Implementation**:
- **Authentication Checks**: Prevents usage when not logged in
- **Dynamic UI Creation**: Creates comment input boxes on-demand
- **Smooth Animations**: 
  - Slide up/down transitions with opacity changes
  - Scale feedback on button clicks
  - Color state changes (blue when active)
- **Smart State Management**:
  - Proper icon switching (plus ‚Üî x)
  - Context-aware tooltips
  - Auto-focus on input when opened
- **Enhanced Input Box**:
  - User profile picture integration
  - Send button with proper styling
  - Border radius and modern design
  - Enter key support

## Technical Improvements üîß

### Enhanced CSS Animations

}

.comment-like-btn {
  transition: all 0.2s ease;
  border-radius: 12px;
  padding: 2px 6px;

.add-comment-inline {
  background: rgba(248,249,250,0.5);
