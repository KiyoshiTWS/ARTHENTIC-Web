- âœ… ArtHub social media functionality
- âœ… Demo data for testing
- âœ… No server dependencies

### To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Select "Deploy from a branch" 
4. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
5. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

### Local Development:
