## GitHub Pages Deployment

This project has been modified to work as a static site that can be hosted on GitHub Pages. The backend functionality has been replaced with client-side JavaScript that uses localStorage for data persistence and Firebase for production mode.

### Features:
- âœ… Static HTML/CSS/JS files compatible with GitHub Pages
- âœ… Firebase integration for production mode
- âœ… Client-side fallback with localStorage for demo mode
- âœ… ArtHub social media functionality
- âœ… User authentication and data storage
- âœ… Comment system with proper permissions
- âœ… No server dependencies for static hosting

### To deploy on GitHub Pages:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings > Pages
3. Select "Deploy from a branch" 
4. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
5. Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/repository-name`

### Local Development:
```bash
# Simple HTTP server (Python)
python -m http.server 8000

# Or use Node.js server for full functionality
node server.js

# Or use any static file server
npx serve .
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` (Python) or `http://localhost:3000` (Node.js) to view the site locally.
